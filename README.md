# records-j
records system (builds on type-system-j)

this project uses typesystem-j

It enhances J, with record data structures that can be used to provide multiple parameter functions with type validated and coerced paramters, as well as pre and post function call validation.

It is powerful enough to create single line GUI calls, and is one of the main benefits provided by a dynamic type system.

A form generator is provided for Jqt, but any backend including the web can be provided with the same interface.
